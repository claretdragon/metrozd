Learned to make a rails plugin from railscast
http://railscasts.com/episodes/135-making-a-gem?view=asciicast

Rails 3.2 complained I had Rails 2.3 style plugins and directed me to this link.
http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2012/1/4/rails-3-2-0-rc2-has-been-released

Not much help.

This gave a little insight but what I want is to add my gemfile to the bundle and then run a rake task-not manually have to copy a bunch of files around.
